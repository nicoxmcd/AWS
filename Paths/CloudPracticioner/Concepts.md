# Concepts of Cloud Computing
## Introduction to Cloud Computing

### Defining the Cloud
We can use it to pass information, store data, and more. The internet itself is made up of copper wires and global network of billions of devices.

A browser sends a request to our internet service provider, they then send a request to a server for the domain name requested. If there's a match, it sends data packets back to our machine.

Cloud computing is an on-demand, pay-as-you-go delivery of compute, database storage, application, and other IT resources.

### Traditional Procurement Process
**Servers**
- Searching for a server that meets specific needs
- Get a quote from the manufacturer
- Send the quote for approval from finance
- Immediately pay and then order the server
- However, if it didn't meet your needs, the process repeats

### History
**1950s Mainframe Computing**
A central computer accessed by many user devices sending requests to the central computer.

**1970s Virtual Machines**
Multiple complete operating systems that "live" in a single piece of hardware. Hypervisors: software that links multiple hardware to use as one giant resource, an early iteration of cloud computing.

**2020s The Cloud**
We can connect to the countless servers provided by big service providers linked by hypervisors. There's unlimited access and limitless potential.

## Concepts
Cloud services are available from any machine connected on the internet. 

**Main Advantages**
- Trade capital expense for variable expense
- Benefit from massive economies of scale
- Stop guessing capacity
- Increase speed and agility
- Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
- Go global in minutes

**Other Advantages**
- There's no need for physical servers or cabling
- No need for server room setup or maintenance
- No hardware replacement or procurement
- Pay only when and what you consume
- Scale up or down instantly
- Benefit from economy of scale (cheaper)

## Well-Architected Framework
How to build the most secure, durable, efficient, and high-performing IT infrastructure possible:
1. Avoid Unnecessary Costs
- Use only what you need
- Reserve resources in advance (discounts)
- Continue to monitor for optimization
2. Reliability
- Dynamically adjust computer resources
- Automatically recover from service disruptions
- Test disaster recovery settings
- Incorporate redundancy
- Have duplicate copies of resources
